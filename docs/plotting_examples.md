# Introduction
The performance of a robot can be measured by a number of different metrics. The appropriate visualization depends on the type of parameters selected. Within the bounds of readability, the following selection of parameters is possible:
- [One variable Visualization](#one-variable-visualization)
- [Two variable Visualization](#two-variable-visualization)
- [Three variable Visualization](#three-variable-visualization)

The following performance parameter are being calculated by the arena-evaluation script:
#### Qualitative Plots
#### Quantitative Plots
The simulation data can be evaluated various different metrics:
- `Success`: Is a binary classifier which determines, whether the robot reached the navigation goal within the given time frame and below the collision threshold
- `Collisions`: Measures the number of collisions of the robot with obstacles, by checking whether obstacles have been registered by the range-laser very close to the obstacle.
- `Path-length`: Measuring the number of meters taken by the roboter to reach the navigation goal. 
- `Normalized-curvature`: Is a measure to quantify the degree of trajectory changes.
- `Roughness`: A value to quantify the trajectory smoothness
- `Angle-over-length`: An alternative measure of smoothness
- `Velocity`: The velocity of the robot [m/s]
- `Jerk`: The jerk of the robot [m/sÂ³]

The following table gives you an insight into the variable type of the parameter, which is important for choosing the right representation.
